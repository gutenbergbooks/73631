<p>“Vildanden” is perhaps the most difficult of all
Ibsen’s prose dramas to translate. Some of the
speeches of Gina and Relling are indeed quite untranslatable.
The difficulty in the case of Gina is in
respect to her frequent malapropisms, which, for the
most part, turn on the mispronunciation of a word, or
the use of a word which resembles in sound the one
she wants. It is obvious that in the transference of
such blunders of one language to another their exact
significance can not be caught. Occasionally it has
been possible, as when she says “divide” for “divert,”
or calls the pistol “pigstol.” But these instances are
rare, and more frequently Gina’s slips could only have
been indicated by entirely changing her words. As I
have aimed at making as literal a translation as possible
I did not feel justified in so departing from the
original.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Werle’s</span> <i>House. Richly and comfortably furnished study.
Book cases and upholstered furniture, a writing-table,
with papers and ledgers in the center of the stage;
lamps alight with green shades, so that the room is
dimly lighted. Open folding-doors, with the curtain
drawn at back. Beyond a large elegant room, brilliantly
lighted with lamps and branched candlesticks. At the
right lower entrance of the study a small baize door
leads to the office. Left lower entrance a fireplace, with
glowing coals, and beyond this a folding-door leading
to the dining-room.</i>]</p>

waiter</i>, <span class="smcap">Jensen</span>, <i>in black, are setting the study in order.
In the large room two or three other hired waiters are
moving about, trimming and lighting several more
lights. From within the dining-room, is heard a confused
buzz of conversation and laughter; a knife is
<ins id='c005b' title='original: wrapped'>rapped</ins> against a glass, there is silence, a toast is
given, cries of “bravo,” and then again the buzz of
conversation.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen</span> (<i>lighting a lamp on the mantel-piece, and
placing a shade upon it</i>). Just listen, Jensen; there’s the
old chap standing up by the table and proposing to
Mrs. Sorby’s health in a long speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen</span> (<i><ins id='c006' title='original: bring'>bringing</ins> down an arm-chair</i>). Is there any truth
in what people say, that there’s something between
them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> Goodness knows!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> For he’s been a great rake in his time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> Maybe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> It’s in honor of his son that he’s giving this
dinner, they say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> Yes, his son came home yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> I never knew before that Mr. Werle had a
son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> Oh yes, he has a son. But he’s always
stopped up there at the Hojdal Works. He’s not been
in town all the years I’ve been in service here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Waiter</span> (<i>at the door of the other room</i>). I say,
Pettersen, here’s an old fellow who——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen</span> (<i>muttering</i>). Who the devil’s here now?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Old Ekdal</span> <i>enters the room from the right. He wears a
threadbare cloak with a stand-up collar, woollen mittens;
in his hands a stick and a fur cap, under his arm a
parcel done up in cardboard. He has a reddish-brown,
dirty wig, and a small mustache.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen</span> (<i>going towards him</i>). Good gracious! What
do you want here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>in the doorway</i>). Must absolutely go to the
office, Pettersen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> The office was closed an hour ago and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Heard so at the door, my lad. But Graberg’s
in there still. Be a good fellow, Pettersen, and let me
slip in this way. (<i>Pointing to the baize door.</i>) I’ve been
that way before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> All right, you can go. (<i>Opens door.</i>) But
mind you leave the proper way, for we’ve company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Know that—h’m! Thanks, Pettersen, my
lad. Good old friend. Thanks. (<i>Mutters in a low
tone.</i>) Idiot!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>He goes into the office.</i> <span class="smcap">Pettersen</span> <i>closes the door after him</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> Is he one of the clerks too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> No, he only does writing at home when
it’s wanted. But he’s been a great swell in his time,
has old Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> Yes, he looks as if he had been a little of
everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> Yes, for you know he’s been a lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> The devil he has! He been a lieutenant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> That he has. But then he went into the
timber trade or something of the sort. They say he
played Mr. Werle a very dirty trick once. For the two
were partners then up at the <ins id='c007a' title='original: Hodjal'>Hojdal</ins> Works, you know.
Ah, I know good old Ekdal, I do. We drink many a
good bottle of beer and bitters together at Mrs.
<ins id='c007b' title='original: Eriksen’s'>Ericksen’s</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> Surely he hasn’t got much to stand treat
with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> Lord, Jensen, of course you understand
that I pay. For I think one should be polite to better
people who’ve come down in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> Did he go bankrupt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> No, it was worse than that. He was
sent to gaol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jensen.</span> Gaol?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pettersen.</span> Or the house of correction, or something.

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>who has heard everything</i>). You shouldn’t
have asked me, Gregers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What? Why, they say this dinner is given
in my honor, and I shouldn’t have my best, my only
friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But I don’t think your father likes it. I
never come to this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So I hear. But I must see you and talk
to you, for I shall certainly go away again soon. Yes,
we two old school-fellows, we have surely been separated
long enough, we’ve not seen one another now
for sixteen—seventeen years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Is it so long?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, it is. Well, how are things going
with you? You look well. You’ve grown almost
stout and portly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> H’m, one can hardly call it portly, but I
daresay I look rather more manly than I did then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Indeed you do; your outer man hasn’t
suffered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>gloomily</i>). But the inner man! Believe
me, that is very different. You know what terrible
trouble has come to me and mine since we two met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>in a lower tone</i>). How is your father getting
on now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Dear friend, don’t let us speak of that.
My poor, unhappy father of course lives at home with
me. Why, he has no one else on earth to cling to.
But it is such bitter pain for me to speak of this, you
see. Tell me, rather, how you have got on up there at
the <ins id='c010' title='Original: works'>Works</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I’ve been delightfully lonely—with plenty
of time to ponder over many things. Come here, let’s
make ourselves comfortable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>He sits down in an arm-chair by the fire, and makes
<span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> take another one by his side</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>moved</i>). I have to thank you all the same,
Gregers, for asking me to your father’s table. For
now I know you’ve no feeling against me any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Whatever makes you think I
had any feeling against you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yet you had during the first years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What first years?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> After the great misfortune. And it was
so natural you should have. Why, it was only by a
hair’s breadth your father escaped being dragged into
this—this horrible affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And you thought I had a feeling against
you because of this? What can have put such a thing
into your head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I know you had, Gregers, for I had it
from your father himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>starting</i>). Father! So! H’m! Was that
why you never wrote to me—not a single word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Not even when you decided to go in for
photography?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Your father said it was no use writing to
you about anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking straight in front of him</i>). No, no.
Perhaps he was right. But tell me, Hjalmar, do you
feel satisfied with your position?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>). Oh, yes; certainly. I really
can’t say I’m not. At first, as you will understand, it
all seemed so strange to me to be placed amid such
absolutely new surroundings. But, then, everything
else was so changed too. The great, overwhelming
misfortune with my father—the shame and the
scandal, Gregers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>moved</i>). Yes, yes, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I couldn’t dream of going on with my
studies, there wasn’t a shilling to spare; on the contrary
we were rather in debt; mostly to your father, I fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> H’m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> So I thought it best, just with one wrench,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
you know, to cut myself off from the old conditions and
relations. It was your father, principally, who advised
me to do this, and as he helped me so much——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, of course; you know he did. Where
should I have got the means to learn photography, to
set up a studio, and make a start? That costs money,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And father paid for all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, dear friend, didn’t you know? I
understood him to say he had written to you about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Not a word of what he had done. He must
have forgotten it. We’ve only exchanged business
letters with one another. So it was father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, sure enough. He never wished
people to know about it, but it was he. And it was he,
too, who made it possible for me to get married<ins id='c012' title='original: ?'>.</ins> But
perhaps you don’t know about that either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, I certainly did not (<i>shakes his arm</i>). My
dear, Hjalmar, I can’t tell you how happy all this makes
me—and how it pains me. Perhaps, after all, I have
wronged father—in certain things. For this shews he
has a heart, you see. It shews a kind of conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Conscience!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, yes, or whatever you like to call it.
No, I have no words to tell you how glad I am to hear
this of father. And so you are married, Hjalmar.
That’s more than I shall ever manage. Well, I hope
you are happy in your marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, I am indeed. She is as bright and
brave a woman as man could desire. And she is not
quite without education, either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>slightly astonished</i>). No, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No. Life is an education, you see. Then
the daily intercourse with me—and then there are
some gifted men who often come to see us, I assure
you. You wouldn’t know Gina again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Gina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, dear friend. Didn’t you remember
her name was Gina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Her name was Gina? Why, I know nothing——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But don’t you remember she was in service
here for a time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking at him</i>). Is it Gina Hansen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, of course it’s Gina Hansen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Who looked after the house during the last
year that mother lay ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Certainly that is so. But, dear friend, I’m
quite certain your father wrote you I had got married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>who has risen</i>). Yes, he certainly did, but
not that—(<i>walks up and down</i>). Yet—wait a moment—perhaps
he did—now I come to think of it. But
father always writes me such short letters. (<i>Half seating
himself on the arm of the chair.</i>) Now tell me,
Hjalmar—for this is too delightful—how did you get
to know Gina—to know your wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Very simply. Gina didn’t stop here long,
for there was so much confusion here at that time—your
mother’s illness—Gina could not see to everything,
so she gave notice and left. That was a year
before your mother’s death—or maybe the same year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It was the same year, and I was up at the
<ins id='c013' title='Original: works'>Works</ins> at the time. And then afterwards——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, Gina lived at home with her mother,
a Mrs. Hansen—a very worthy and hard-working
woman, who kept a small eating-house. And she had
a room to let, too, a very pretty, comfortable room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And you were probably delighted to take it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, indeed; it was your father who suggested
it to me. And there, you see—there I really
got to know Gina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And so you got engaged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes. Young folk soon get to care for one
another—h’m——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>rises and walks up and down</i>). Tell me—when
you got engaged—was it then that father—I mean—was
it then that you began to take up photography?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Exactly, for I was anxious to settle down
as soon as possible. And so both your father and I
thought photography would be the likeliest thing,
and Gina thought so, too. And there was a reason
for that, you see, it fitted in so well, as Gina had learnt
to retouch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> That fitted in most remarkably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>delighted, rising</i>). Yes, didn’t it? Don’t you
think it fitted in remarkably?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, I must confess it did. Father seems
to have been almost a sort of Providence to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>moved</i>). He did not forsake the son of his
old friend in his hour of need, for he has a heart, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fat Gentleman.</span> Yes, it tastes remarkably delicate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). Is there any difference then

<p><span class="smcap">Fat Gentleman</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Oh, that is good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, light has a great deal to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Why, that’s exactly as it is with chamberlains,

forest business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> But wasn’t it Ekdal who drew up the map
of the forest—that falsified map? It was he who
carried out the illegal felling of trees on the government
lands. Why, it was he who managed the whole
business up there. I had no idea of what Lieutenant
Ekdal was undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Lieutenant Ekdal himself did not know
what he had undertaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Maybe, but the fact remains that he was
sentenced and I was acquitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, I know. Proofs were wanting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Acquittal is acquittal. But why rake up all
this unfortunate business that turned my hair grey
before its time? Have you been brooding over this
all these years up at the Works? I can assure you,
Gregers, here in town, the story has long been forgotten,
as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But the unfortunate Ekdals?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Now, really, what would you have had me
do for these people? When Ekdal came out he was a
broken man, absolutely helpless. There are men on
earth who sink to the bottom if they get a few shots
in them and who never come to the surface again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
You may take my word, Gregers, I went as far as I
could without exposing myself, and giving color to
all sorts of suspicions and gossip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Suspicions—I see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> I’ve given Ekdal copying to do for the office,

doubt that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> You laugh. Don’t you believe what I say?
It is true there’s nothing of all this in my books, for
there are certain expenses I never enter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>smiling coldly</i>). No, there are certain
expenses which it is best not to enter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle</span> (<i>starting</i>). What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>with forced calm</i>). Have you entered what it

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> I? Entered what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I know now that it was you who paid for
that. And I know, too, that it was you who so
generously helped him to make a start.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Well, and yet you say <ins title="original: I ve">I’ve</ins> done nothing for
the Ekdals! I can assure you, in all conscience, these
people have cost me quite enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Have you entered any of these expenses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Why do you ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh, I have my reasons. Listen. At the
time when you interested yourself so warmly in the
son of your old friend, was that not the very time
when he was to get married?</p>

remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> At that time you wrote me a letter—a business
letter, of course—and in a postscript you briefly
said that Hjalmar Ekdal had married a Miss Hansen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Well, that was right enough—that was her

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But you did not write that the Miss Hansen

<p><span class="smcap">Werle</span> (<i>laughs sarcastically but somewhat constrainedly</i>).
No, it really never occurred to me that you were so
deeply interested in our former housekeeper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Nor was I. But (<i>in a lower voice</i>) there
was another here in the house who was deeply
interested in her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> What do you mean (<i>angrily to him</i>)? I
suppose you are alluding to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>in a low but firm tone</i>). Yes, I allude to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> And you dare? You permit yourself to? How
can he, that ungrateful wretch, the photographer? How
dare he presume to make such insinuations?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Hjalmar has not referred to all this by a
single word. I don’t believe he so much as suspects
anything of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Whom have you had it from then? Who can
have said such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> My poor, unhappy mother said so. And
that was the last time I saw her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Your mother? I might have known it. She
and you—you always held together. It was she who
from the first turned you against me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No—it was all she had to bear and to
suffer, until her heart was broken, and the miserable
end came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Oh, she hadn’t so much to bear and suffer—not
more at any rate, than so many others! But there
is no getting on with morbid, overstrained people. As
I know to my cost. And so you have gone about
nourishing such suspicions, gone poking into all sorts
of old rumors and calumnies against your own father.
Look here, Gregers. I really think that at your age
you might find something better to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, it is time I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Then perhaps you would take things more
easily than you seem to now. What can be the good
of your stopping up there at the Works year out, year
in, worrying yourself as a mere clerk, and refusing to
take a shilling more than the usual monthly salary?
It’s simple folly of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, if I could be quite certain that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> I understand you well enough. You want
to be independent, to owe nothing to me. But now
there is an opening for you to become independent, and
absolutely your own master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Indeed, how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> When I wrote you it was necessary you
should come to town immediately—h’m——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, what did you really want me for? I’ve
been waiting all day to find out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> I wished to propose your having a share in
the firm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I? Enter the firm? As partner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Yes. It will not necessitate our being constantly
together. You might take over the business
here, and then I’d move up to the Works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> <i>You</i> would?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Yes, for you see I’m not so fit for work as I
used to be. I must be careful of my eyes, Gregers,
for they are becoming rather weak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> They always were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Not so weak as now. And then besides—circumstances
might perhaps make it desirable I
should live up there—at any rate, for a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I should never have believed that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> See here, Gregers, there are many things that
stand between us. But when all’s said and done—we
are father and son. It seems to me we ought to be
able to come to some sort of an understanding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You mean outwardly, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Well, even that would be something. Think
it over, Gregers. Don’t you believe that it could be
managed? Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking at him coldly</i>). There is something
behind all this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> How so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> There must be something you want to use
me for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> In so close a relation as ours, the one can
always be of use to the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So they say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> I would gladly have you at home with me
now for a time. I am a lonely man, Gregers—always
have felt lonely all my life through—but most now
that I am beginning to grow old. I long to have
some one about me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Well, you have Mrs. Sorby——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Yes, I have, and she has, so to say, become
almost indispensable to me. She is bright and even-tempered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
she cheers up the house—and I need that
so sorely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Very well. Then you’ve already got all
you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Yes, but I’m afraid things can’t go on so.
A woman in such circumstances soon finds herself in
an equivocal position in the eyes of the world. And I
had almost said that it doesn’t do a man any good
either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh, when a man gives such dinners as you
do he can risk a good deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Yes, but <i>she</i>, Gregers? I’m afraid she will
not put up with it much longer. And even if she
would—even if she were willing, out of devotion to
me, to expose herself to the gossip and scandal, and
all that—don’t you think, Gregers, you, with your
intensely strong sense of justice——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). Just tell me one thing straight
out. Are you thinking of marrying her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> And if I were thinking of such a thing,
what then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I say so, too. What then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Would you set yourself absolutely against
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, certainly not; not in any way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> For I did not know whether, from love for
your dead mother’s memory——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I am not overstrained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Well, whatever you may or may not be, you
have lifted a heavy weight from my heart. I am so
exceedingly glad that I may count upon your approval
in this matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking fixedly at him</i>). Now I know you
mean to use me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Use you? What an expression!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Ah, don’t let us be nice in our choice of
words—not when we are alone, at any rate. (<i>Laughs
shortly.</i>) So that’s it! So that was why—curse it!——
I must come to town in person. For the benefit of
Mrs. Sorby, a scene of family life is to be arranged
here. Tableau of father and son! That would be
something new!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> How dare you speak in that tone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> When was there any family life here? Not
as long as I can remember. But <i>now</i> a little of that
sort of thing may come in useful. For it would look
uncommonly well to have people talking of the son
hurrying hither—on the wings of filial piety—to his
old father’s wedding feast. What then becomes of all
the rumors of the poor dead mother’s sorrows and
suffering? Nothing! Her son hurls them to the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Gregers, I don’t believe there is a man on
earth you dislike as you do me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>in a low voice</i>). I have seen you too closely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> You have seen me through your mother’s
eyes. (<i>Slightly lowering his voice.</i>) But you should
bear in mind that her eyes were—dimmed at times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>shuddering</i>). I understand what you mean.
But who was to blame for mother’s unhappy weakness?
It was you and all these—— The last of them was
that woman who was foisted upon Hjalmar Ekdal,
when you no longer—oh!——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle</span> (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>). Word for word as if
I heard your mother!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>without noticing him</i>). And there he is now
with his great, unsuspecting child-mind, in the midst
of deception—lives under the same roof with such a
woman, and does not know that what he calls home is
built upon a lie. (<i>He comes up closer.</i>) When I look
back upon all you have done, I seem to be looking
over a battlefield, with ruined human lives everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> I almost believe the gulf between us is too
great——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>bowing with forced self-command</i>). I have
observed it, and so I’ll take my hat and go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Go! Leave the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes. For now at last I have found a
mission to live for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> What mission may that be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You would only laugh if I told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> A lonely man does not laugh so easily,
Gregers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>pointing to the room in the background</i>). See,
father—the Chamberlains are playing Blind Man’s
Buff with Mrs. Sorby. Good night—and good-bye.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>He goes out at the back, right. The laughter and merriment

<p>[<span class="smcap">Hjalmar Ekdal’s</span> <i>studio. The room is fairly large: it is
evidently at the top of the house. To the right a slanting
roof with large panes of glass, half covered by a
blue curtain. In a corner, to the right of the stage, is
the entrance-door; lower down, on the same side, a door
leading to the sitting-room. At the back to the left, there
are also two doors, an iron stove between them. In the
wall at the back there is a wide sliding door, which can
be pushed aside. The studio is plainly, but comfortably
arranged and furnished. Between the doors on the
right, a little away from the wall, there is a sofa, with a
table and a few chairs; on the table a lamp with a shade,
by the stove an old arm-chair. All sorts of photographic
apparatus and instruments are distributed about the
room. In the back wall to the left of the sliding door is
a book case, with a few books, boxes, and bottles of
chemicals, instruments, tools, etc. Photographs and
odds and ends, such as camel-hair brushes, paper, and
the like, lie on the table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, but my mother, mayn’t I read a little
longer? Just a little bit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, no; you must put the book away now.
Your father doesn’t like it. He never reads himself of
an evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>shutting the door</i>). No, father doesn’t bother
much about reading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>putting down her work and taking up a pencil and

much the butter came to to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> One <ins id='c031' title='original: knone'>krone</ins> and sixty-five ore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> That’s right. (<i>Entering it.</i>) It’s awful the
amount of butter we get through here. And then
there was the smoked sausage and cheese. Let me
see—(<i>writing</i>) and then there was the ham—h’m!
(<i>Reckoning it up.</i>) Yes, it makes just——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> And then there’s the beer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, of course. (<i>Writing.</i>) It does run up—but
it can’t be helped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> But then we didn’t want a hot dinner, as
father was out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, luckily. And then besides I took eight
crowns, fifty ore for the photographs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Fancy! So much as that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Exactly eight crowns, fifty ore.</p>

You know it was his son who invited him. (<i>Quickly.</i>)
We’ve nothing to do with Mr. Werle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> I’m looking forward so to father coming
home. For he promised he’d ask Mrs. Sorby for something

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, that’s so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Good Heavens! My poor, white-haired old
father?—Yes, just let him alone for once and enjoy
himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Old</i> <span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> <i>in an old coat, and with a lighted pipe, enters
from his room</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Got home? I thought I heard you chattering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I’ve just come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> So you didn’t see me? You didn’t?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, but they said you’d passed through
the room—and so I came after you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> H’m! Very good of you, Hjalmar. What
sort of people were they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh, all sorts of people. There was
Chamberlain Flor, and Chamberlain Balle, and
Chamberlain Kasperson—and Chamberlain—so and
so—I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>nodding</i>). Listen to <i>that</i>, Gina. He’s been
with nothing but Chamberlains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, they are awfully grand up at the house
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Did the Chamberlains sing, father, or did
they recite something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, they only chatted. They wanted me
to recite—but I wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> You wouldn’t?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But surely you might have done that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, one can’t provide entertainment for
everybody. (<i>Walking up and down.</i>) At any rate, I
can’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> No, no, Hjalmar’s not to be got so easily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I really don’t see why I should provide
entertainment, when I once in a way happen to go
out. Let others do it. Here are these fine folk
dining in grand houses day out, day in. Let them be
thankful and amiable for all the good meals they get.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But surely you didn’t say that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>humming</i>). Ha! ha! ha! They had put
up all sorts of things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Even the Chamberlains?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> They didn’t get off scot-free. (<i>Lightly.</i>)
Then we had a little discussion as to Tokay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Tokay? You? That’s a fine wine, that is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>standing still suddenly</i>). It <i>may</i> be fine, but
I may tell you all vintages are not equally good. It
depends upon the amount of sunshine the vine has
had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Why, you really know everything, Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> And there was a discussion about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> They wanted to prove that; but then it
was proved to them that it was exactly the same with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Chamberlains. With them too, all vintages were not
equally good—so some one said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No! What things you do think of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> He, he! And they had to put that in their
pipes and smoke it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> They had it straight to their faces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Fancy, Gina, he said that straight to the
Chamberlain’s faces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Only think, straight to their faces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, but I don’t wish it talked about.
One doesn’t repeat such things. Besides, of course it
all passed off quite good-naturedly. Why, they were
nice, pleasant people why should I wound them? No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> But straight to their faces——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>coaxingly</i>). How nice it is to see you in a
dress-coat. You look so well in a dress-coat, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, don’t you think so? And this one
really sits faultlessly. It fits almost as if it had been
made for me—a little tight in the arm-pits, perhaps.
Help me, Hedvig. (<i>Takes off the coat.</i>) I’d rather put
on my jacket. Where is my jacket, Gina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Here it is. (<i>She fetches the jacket and helps him
on with it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That’s it. Be sure and remember to let
Molvik have the dress-coat the first thing in the
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>putting it down</i>). I’ll see to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>stretching himself</i>). Ah! After all, this is
more comfortable. And, besides, this sort of loose,
free, home-dress suits my whole style better. Don’t
you think so, Hedvig?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> When I tie my necktie like this, with
loose ends, see, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, that looks very well with the
moustache and the thick curly hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> One can’t call it exactly curly hair. I
should rather say wavy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, for it’s in such great curls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Waves!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>a little after, pulling his jacket</i>). Father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, you know well enough what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, I really don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>laughing and pouting</i>). Oh, you do, father.
Now you <ins id='c039' title="original: musn’t">mustn’t</ins> tease me any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>shaking him</i>). Oh, nonsense. Now out with
it, father. You know all the good things you
promised me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! and to think I should have forgotten
it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, you only want to tease me, father! Oh,
it’s too bad of you. Where’ve you put them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, I’ve not quite forgotten. But wait a
moment! I’ve got something else for you, Hedvig.
(<i>Goes and searches in the pockets of his coat.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>jumping and clapping her hands</i>). Oh, mother,
mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> You see, if you’ll only wait——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>with a paper</i>). See, here we have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> That? Why, that’s only a piece of paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That’s the bill of fare; the whole bill of
fare. Here is written “Menu;” that means bill of fare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Haven’t you got anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I’ve forgotten the rest, I tell you. But you
may take my word for it, these dainties are not very
satisfying. Sit down there by the table and read out
the list, and I’ll describe the dishes to you. See here,
Hedvig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>choking back her tears</i>). Thanks. (<i>She sits
down, but does not read.</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>makes signs to her</i>; <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>
<i>notices it</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>walking up and down</i>). It is really most
extraordinary what things the bread-winner of a family
is expected to remember, and if he forgets the least of
them—he’s sure to be treated to black looks. Well,
one gets used to that, too. (<i>Stops near the stove, by the
old man.</i>) Have you peeped in there this evening,
father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Yes, you may be sure I did. She’s got into
the basket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No! <i>She’s</i> gone into the basket? She’s
beginning to get used to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Yes, that’s what I always said she would. But
now, you see, there are a few little things——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Some improvements—yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> But they must be made, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, let’s have a little chat about the
improvements, father. Come here, let’s sit on the sofa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> All right. H’m—think I’ll fill my pipe
first—and must clean it. H’m! (<i>He goes into his room.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>smiling at</i> <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>). Clean his pipe, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah, well! Gina, let him alone. My poor
shipwrecked father! Yes—the improvements—we’d
best set about them to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> You’ll not have any time to-morrow, Ekdal——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). Oh, yes, he will, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Remember those copies that have to be touched
up; they’ve sent here now so many times for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Really? So now it’s the copies again!
They’ll be ready soon enough. Have there been any
fresh orders?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, worse luck, to-morrow I’ve nothing but
the two portraits you know of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Nothing else? Oh, no, when one makes
no effort——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But what am I to do? I put in all the advertisements
I can afford, I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, advertisements, advertisements. You
see how much good they are. And so, I suppose, no
one’s been after this room, either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, not yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That was to be expected. When one
makes no effort to—— One really must pull oneself
together, Gina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>going up to him</i>). Shall I fetch your flute,
father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, no flute. I ask no pleasures here on
earth. (<i>Walking up and down.</i>) Yes, yes, I’ll work hard
to-morrow, there shall be no lack of that. I’ll work as
long as my strength holds out——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But, dear good Ekdal, I didn’t mean it in <i>that</i>
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Father, shall I bring in a bottle of beer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, nothing at all. I want nothing for
myself. (<i>Standing still.</i>) Beer?—was it beer you said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>brightly</i>). Yes, father; lovely, fresh beer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, if you <i>will</i> insist, you may as well
bring in a bottle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, do, and then we’ll make ourselves
comfortable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>runs towards the kitchen door</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>by the stove; stops her, looks at her, takes her
head, and presses her to him</i>). Hedvig! Hedvig!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>gladly, with tears in her eyes</i>). Ah! Dear
father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, do not call me that! There have I
been sitting at the rich man’s table and taking thought
for myself—there have I sat and reveled at the
groaning board. And yet I could not——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>sitting by the table</i>). Oh, nonsense, nonsense,
Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes! But you must not be too hard upon
me. You know that I am very fond of you, all the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>embracing him</i>). And we are so immensely
fond of you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> And if now and again I should be unreasonable,
bear in mind I am a man overwhelmed by a host
of worries. No! (<i>Drying his eyes.</i>) No beer at such
a moment! Give me the flute.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>runs to the book case and fetches it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Thanks. Now then. With the flute in my
hand, and you two about me—ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>sits down at the table near</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span>; <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> <i>walks
up and down. Then he begins playing energetically a

sentimental expression. He stops playing suddenly, holds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
out his left hand to</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span>, <i>and says in a moved tone</i>). It may

But I tell you this—it is good to be here.</p>

<p><i>He begins playing again; presently a knock is heard at the

there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>putting the flute into the book case</i>). There
again!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>goes and opens the door</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>outside in the passage</i>). Excuse me——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>stepping back a little</i>). Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Does Mr. Ekdal, the photographer, live
here?——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>going to the door</i>). Gregers! Is it you after
all? Well, come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>coming in</i>). Yes, I told you I’d look you up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But to-night?—Have you left the party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Both the party and my father’s house.
Good evening, Mrs. Ekdal. I don’t know if you recognize
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh, yes! Young Mr. Werle is not very
difficult to recognize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No—I am like my mother, and, no doubt,
you remember her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> And you have left the house, you say——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, I’ve moved into a hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Really! Well, as you’ve come, take off
your things and sit down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Thanks. (<i>He takes off his overcoat. He has
changed into a simple gray suit of country make.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Here, on the sofa. Make yourself at home.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> <i>sits on the sofa</i>, <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> <i>on a chair by the table</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking round</i>). So this is your place, Hjalmar.
This is where you live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> This is the studio, as you can see——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But it’s roomy; and so we prefer sitting here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> We used to have better rooms, but this
flat has one great advantage; there are such capital
outer rooms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> And then we’ve a room on the other side of
the passage that we can let.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>). Really—then you’ve lodgers,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, not yet. That’s not so easy, you see;
one has to keep on the look out. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span>.) But
how about that beer, Hedvig.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>nods and goes into the kitchen</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So <i>that</i> is your daughter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, that’s Hedvig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And she is your only child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> She is the only one, yes. She is our greatest
joy on earth, and (<i>in a lower tone</i>), she is also our
greatest sorrow, Gregers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What’s that you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes; for there is imminent danger of her
losing her sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Become blind!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes. At present there are only the merest
symptoms, and it may be a long while yet. But the
doctor has warned us. It must inevitably come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> That is a terrible misfortune! How did
she get it?——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>sighing</i>). It is probably hereditary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>starting</i>). Hereditary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Ekdal’s mother had weak eyes, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, so father says; I can’t remember her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Poor child! And how does she take it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! you may imagine, we’ve not had the
heart to tell her anything. She has no idea of any
danger. Joyous and free from care, and chirping like
a little bird flying away into life’s everlasting night.
(<i>Overcome.</i>) Ah! that is such a crushing blow for me,
Gregers.</p>

(<span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>throws her arms round his neck and whispers into

straight in front of him.</i>) Yes, perhaps Gregers will
have a piece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>with a gesture of refusal</i>). No, no, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>still mournful</i>). Well, you can bring in a

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, thank God, there’s nothing else the
matter with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No doubt she will grow like you in time,
Mrs. Ekdal. How old may she be now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Hedvig is exactly fourteen; it’s her birthday
the day after to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> She’s pretty tall for her age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, she has shot up so in the last year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It is by these young folks that we best see
how old we are ourselves. How long ago is it that
you were married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Why, we were married in—yes—nearly
fifteen years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, really! Is it so long!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>becoming attentive, looking at him</i>). Yes, it is
exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, of course it is. Fifteen years in a few
months. (<i>In a changed tone.</i>) Those must have been
long years for you up at the Works, Gregers.</p>

Gregers Werle—I don’t know if you can remember him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>going up to him</i>). I only wanted to bring
you a greeting from the old hunting-grounds, Lieutenant
Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, up there round about the Hojdal
Works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Oh? up there? I knew them well once on a

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> At that time you were a great sportsman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Was so, yes. That may be. You’re looking
at my uniform-cap. I don’t need to get leave to wear
it at home. So long as I don’t go out into the streets
in it——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Can you remember, Lieutenant Ekdal,

summer and at Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Did you? No, no, no—I don’t remember
that. But I may say I’ve been a great sportsman, that
I have. I’ve shot bears too. Shot nine of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking sympathizingly at him</i>). And now
you never get any hunting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Oh! Can’t say that, my lad. Get some
hunting now and again: not <i>that</i> sort, of course. For
the forest, you see—the forest, the forest!—— (<i>Drinking.</i>)
Is the forest up there fine now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Not so fine as in your time. It’s been
thinned out considerably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Thinned out. (<i>In a lower tone and anxiously.</i>)
That’s a dangerous game. It has consequences. The
forest avenges itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>filling his glass</i>). Come, father, have a little
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> How can a man like you—such a man for
an open-air life, live in the midst of a choking town,
shut up between these four walls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>smiles slightly and glances at</i> <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>). Oh!
it’s not so bad here. Not so bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But all that had become part of you? The
fresh, blowing breezes, the free life in the woods and
the plains, among the beasts and birds?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Hjalmar, shall we show it him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>quickly and somewhat embarrassed</i>). Oh, no,
no, father; not this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What does he want to show me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh! it’s only something—you can see it
another time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>continuing to the old man</i>). So I was thinking,
Lieutenant Ekdal, that you should come along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
with me up to the Works, for I shall certainly be
leaving again shortly. You could easily get some
copying to do there too. And here there’s absolutely
nothing to make you comfortable and cheer you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>staring at him in astonishment</i>). I’ve absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, you have Hjalmar; but he has his
own family. And a man like you who has always felt
drawn to all that is free and wild——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>striking the table</i>). Hjalmar, now he <i>shall</i> see it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, father, is it worth while now? Why,
it’s dark——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Nonsense; the moon shining. (<i>Rising.</i>) He
<i>shall</i> see it, I say. Let me pass. Come and help me,
Hjalmar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, yes; do, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>rising</i>). All right then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span>). What is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>going over to him</i>). What, is it really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> You can see—h’m!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>rather embarrassed</i>). This belongs to father,
you understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>by the door, looking into the loft</i>). Why, you
keep fowls, Lieutenant Ekdal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Should think we did keep fowls. They’re
gone to roost now. But you should see the fowls by
daylight, you should!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> And then there’s a——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Sh!—Sh!—don’t say anything yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And you’ve pigeons, too, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Oh, yes! May be we’ve got pigeons, too!
The pigeon-houses are up there under the eaves; for
you know pigeons always like to roost high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But these are not all common pigeons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Common! No, should think not! We’ve got
tumblers, and we’ve a few pouters, too. But come
here! Can you see those hutches out there by the
wall?——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes. But what do you use them for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> The rabbits go in there in the night, my lad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Why, you’ve rabbits, too, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Yes. Deuce take it, you might know we
should have rabbits! He wants to know if we’ve got
rabbits, Hjalmar!—H’m! But now the real thing’s
coming, you know. Now then! Out of the way, Hedvig.
Come and stand here; that’s it—and look down
there. Don’t you see anything there in the basket
filled with straw?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes. I see there’s a bird lying in the
basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> H’m! “A bird”——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Isn’t it a duck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>hurt</i>). Yes, of course, it’s a duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But what <i>sort</i> of a duck, do you think——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> It’s not just a simple duck——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Hush!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And it’s not a Turkish duck, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> No, Mr.—Werle; it’s not a Turkish duck;
for it’s a wild duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, is it really? A wild duck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Yes, that it is. The “bird,” as you called
it—is a wild duck. That’s our wild duck, my lad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> <i>My</i> wild duck. For she belongs to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And it can live up here in this loft? And
thrive here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Of course, you understand, she’s got a trough
full of water to splash about in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Fresh water every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>). But, dear Ekdal, it’s
getting awfully cold here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> H’m! Let’s shut it up then. Besides it’s
not good to disturb their night’s rest. Give a hand,
Hedvig.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>push the doors of the loft together</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Another time you can see her properly.
(<i>Sitting down in the arm-chair by the stove.</i>) Ah! wild
ducks are very wonderful creatures, take my word for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But how did you catch it, Lieutenant
Ekdal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Didn’t catch her, I didn’t. There’s a certain
man in the town here, whom we’ve to thank for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>starting slightly</i>). Surely the man’s not my
father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Yes, he is though. Just your father. H’m!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> It is funny you should have guessed that,
Gregers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Why you were telling me that you were
indebted to my father for all sorts of things, and so I
thought that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But we’ve not had the duck from Mr. Werle
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> It’s Haaken Werle we’ve to thank for her,
all the same, Gina. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>.) He was out in his
boat, you know, and he shot her. But your father’s
sight is so bad now. H’m; she was only wounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I see. She got a few shots in her body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, she did—two or three shots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> She was hit under the wing, and so she
could not fly away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And then, I suppose, she dived to the
bottom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>sleepily, with thick utterance</i>). Know all about
that. Always so with wild ducks. Made for the
bottom—as far as they can get, my lad—get caught
in the tangle and the sea-weed—and all the damned
stuff that’s down below there. And so they never
come to the surface again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But, Lieutenant Ekdal, <i>your</i> wild duck
came to the surface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> He’d got a most remarkably clever dog, had
your father. And the dog—dived after the duck and
brought her up again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>). And so you found it here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Not directly; first it was taken to your
father’s; but the wild thing didn’t thrive there; so
Pettersen was ordered to kill it——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>half asleep</i>). H’m—yes, Pettersen—idiot——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>speaking in a lower tone</i>). So that was how
we got her, you see, for father knows Pettersen a little,
and when he heard about the wild duck, he managed
to get it handed over to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And now it thrives so well up here in the
loft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, wonderfully well. She’s getting fat.
Well, she’s been in there so long now she’s forgotten
the old wild life; and that’s the main thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You are right there, Hjalmar. Only never
let her see the sky or the sea—— But I <ins id='c053' title="original: musn’t">mustn’t</ins> stay
any longer; for I think your father’s asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh! don’t mind him——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But—by the way—you said you had a
room to let—a spare room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Certainly—what then? Do you know
anyone——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Could I have the room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, but you, Mr. Werle——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Can I have the room? Then I’ll move in
early to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, with the greatest pleasure——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But, Mr. Werle, it’s not at all the sort of room
for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But, Gina, how can you say that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, for the room’s neither large nor light,
and——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> That doesn’t matter, Mrs. Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I think it’s a very nice room, and not so
badly furnished, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But think of those two who live underneath
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What two are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh! one of them’s been a tutor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That’s Licentiate Molvik.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> And then there’s a doctor calling Relling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Relling? I used to know him a little. He
practiced for a time up at the Works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> They’re a pair of dissipated good-for-nothings.
They’re often out on the loose of an evening, and
they come home very late at night, and then they’re
not always as——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> One soon gets used to that. I hope I shall
be like the wild duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> H’m, I think you’d better sleep on it first, all
the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You seem extremely unwilling to have me
in the house, Mrs. Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Lord, no! How can you think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, it’s really very extraordinary of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). But tell me, are you thinking of
stopping in town then for the present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>putting on his overcoat</i>). Yes, now I think of
stopping here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But not at home with your father? What
do you mean to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Ah! If only I knew <i>that</i> I should not
be so badly off. But when one has the misfortune
to be called Gregers—“Gregers”—and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
“Werle” after it; have you ever heard anything so
hideous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh! I don’t think that so bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Huh! Pish! I should feel inclined to spit
at a fellow with such a name. But when one has the
misfortune to be Gregers—Werle here on earth, as I
have——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Ha—ha! If you weren’t
Gregers Werle, what else would you be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> If I had my choice, I should prefer being
a clever dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> A dog!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>involuntarily</i>). Oh! not that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, a real uncommonly clever dog; such
a one as can dive under after wild ducks, when they
go to the bottom, and get fast in all the tangle and
sea-weeds down in the mud below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I’ll tell you what, Gregers—I don’t
understand a word of all this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh, no! It doesn’t mean anything in particular.
Early to-morrow, then, I’ll move in. (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Gina</span>.) Don’t you trouble about me; I do everything
for myself. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>.) We’ll talk over the rest
to-morrow. Good night, Mrs. Ekdal. (<i>Nodding to</i>
<span class="smcap">Hedvig</span>.) Good night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Good night, Mr. Werle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Good night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>who has lighted a candle</i>). Wait a moment, I

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>looking straight in front of her, with her work on

to be a dog?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> I’ll tell you what, mother—I think he
meant something else by that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> What could <i>that</i> be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Why, I don’t know, but it was just as if he
meant something different from what he was saying—all
the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Do you think so? It was certainly strange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>returning</i>). The lamp was still alight. (<i>Puts
out the light and puts it down</i>.) Ah, at last one can get a
mouthful to eat. (<i>Begins eating the bread and butter.</i>)
Now, you see, Gina, if one only makes a little effort——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> How, effort?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, for it’s a blessing after all we’ve at
last let that room for a time. And only think—to a
fellow like Gregers—a dear, old friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I hardly know what to say about it, I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, mother, you’ll see it’ll be such fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> You <i>are</i> strange. First you were so anxious
to let it, and now you don’t like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, Ekdal; if it had only been to some one
else, but what do you think Mr. Werle will say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Old Werle? It’s no business of his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But you may be sure there’s something up
between them again, as the young one’s moving out of
the house. You know well enough how things are
between those two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, that may be, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> And now, perhaps, Mr. Werle’ll think you’re
at the bottom of it——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Let him think so as long as he likes! Mr.
Werle has done an immense deal for me. Good
heavens! I don’t deny it—but I can’t on that account
remain his dependent all my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But, dear Ekdal, perhaps grandfather may
have to suffer for it; he may <ins id='c057' title='original: loose'>lose</ins> his poor little
earnings that he gets through Graberg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I’m almost inclined to say: so much the
better! Is it not sufficiently humiliating for a man like
me to see his grey-haired father going about as an outcast?
But the fullness of time is coming now, I think.
(<i>He takes another piece of bread and butter.</i>) As surely as
I have a mission in life, so surely I will not shrink
from it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh! no, father, don’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Hush! Don’t wake him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>in a lower tone</i>). I will not shrink from it, I
tell you. The day will yet come, when—— And
that’s why it’s a good thing we’ve let the room; for
that makes me more independent. And a man must
be <i>that</i> when he has a mission in life. (<i>Turning towards
the arm-chair, with emotion.</i>) My poor white-haired old
father! Lean on your Hjalmar. He has broad
shoulders—strong shoulders, at any rate. You will
awaken one day and—— (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span>.) Perhaps, you
don’t believe it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Why he wanted to do everything himself, he
said. And so he wanted to light the stove too; and
then he screwed down the register, so that the whole
room was full of smoke. Uh! It stank like——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, I never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But the best’s to come; for then he wanted to
put out the fire, and so he must needs empty the whole
of his water-jug into the stove, so that the room’s like
a pig-stye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That’s a nuisance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I’ve sent the porter’s wife there now, to clean
up after him, the pig. But the place’ll not be fit to be
in till this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Where’s he gone then in the meantime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> He was going out, he said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I looked in a moment, too—after you’d
gone out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> So I heard. Why, <i>you’ve</i> asked him to lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Only to a little simple bit of early lunch,
you know. It’s his first day—and we couldn’t very
well avoid it. You’ve got something in the house, I
suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I’ll try and get something or other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But don’t get too little. For I fancy
Relling and Molvik are coming up too. I happened
to meet Relling on the stairs, you see, and so I
couldn’t but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh! Are we to have those two as well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Good Lord—two more or less’ll make no
difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal</span> (<i>opening his door and looking in</i>). I say,
Hjalmar—— (<i>noticing</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span>.) Oh! I see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Do you want anything, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Oh, no! It’s all right. H’m! (<i>He goes in
again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>taking up the basket</i>). Take care he doesn’t get
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, yes, I’ll see to it—I say, Gina, a
little bit of herring-salad’d be very nice—for Relling
and Molvik were out on the spree again last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> If only they don’t come up too soon for me
I——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh! they won’t; take your own time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Very good, and you can go on doing a little
work meantime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Why, I’m sitting here working! Why,
I’m working as hard as ever I can!</p>

see.</p>

(<i>She goes up to the table.</i>) Isn’t there any little
thing I could help you with, father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh, no. It’s best I should do it all alone—as

Hedvig; if only your father keeps his health—then——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, thank you, I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>turning to the loft</i>). It looks quite different
in there by daylight from what it did in the moonshine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, it does change so. In the morning it
looks different from the afternoon and when it rains it
looks different than when it’s fine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Have you noticed it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, of course I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Do you, too, like being in there with the
wild duck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, whenever I can manage it I——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But no doubt you’ve not much free time.
I suppose you go to school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, not now; father’s afraid of me spoiling
my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh! then he reads with you himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Father’s promised to read with me, but he’s
not had time for it yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But is there no one else to help you a
little?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, there’s Mr. Molvik; but he not always
quite—exactly—as——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> He drinks then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Well, then you’ve plenty of time to do
anything. And in there—I suppose that’s a world of
itself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Quite of itself. And then there are so many
wonderful things there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, there are great cupboards full of books,
and in some of the books there are pictures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Aha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> And then there’s an old bureau, with
drawers and flaps, and a big clock with figures that
can come out. But the clock doesn’t go now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So time has stood still—in there with the
wild duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes. And then there’s an old paint-box and
so forth; and then all the books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And I suppose you like reading the books?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, yes, when I can get time. But most of
them are English, and I don’t understand it. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
then I look at the pictures. There’s one great book,
called “Harryson’s History of London;” it must be a
hundred years old; and there are such an enormous
lot of pictures in it. On the front page there’s a picture
of Death with an hour-glass, and a young girl. I
think that’s horrid. But then there are all the other
pictures of churches and palaces, and streets, and
great ships sailing on the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But tell me, where did you get all these
rare things from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh! An old sea-captain once lived here,
and he brought them home. They used to call him
“The Flying Dutchman.” And that’s odd, for he wasn’t
a Dutchman at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No. But at last he stopped away altogether,
and all his things were left here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Listen—just tell me—when you sit in
there looking at the pictures, don’t you want to get
out, and see the real great world itself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, no! I want to stop at home always, and
help father and mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Finishing photographs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, not only that. What I should like best
would be to learn to engrave pictures like those in the
English books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> H’m! What does your father say to
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> I don’t think father likes it, for father’s so
odd in some things. Fancy, he talks about my learning
basket-making and straw-plaiting! But I don’t think
<i>that’s</i> anything much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh, no; neither do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> But father’s right about <i>one</i> thing, that if
I’d learnt to make baskets, I might have made the new
basket for the wild duck myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So you might; and you were the right
person to have made it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, for it’s <i>my</i> wild duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, so it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, yes, she belongs to <i>me</i>. But I lend her
to father and grandfather as often as ever they like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Indeed! What do they do with her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh! they arrange things for her, and build
for her, and all that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I understand; for I suppose the wild duck’s
the most distinguished personage in there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Of course she is; for she’s a real wild bird.
And it’s a pity about her, too, for she has no one to
care for, poor thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> She hasn’t a family like the rabbits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No. The fowls, too, have so many they were
chicks with together, but she has been taken right
away from all her own. And then it’s all so strange
about those wild ducks. No one knows them, and
nobody knows where they come from either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And so she has been to the ocean depths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>looks up at him for a moment and smiles</i>). Why
do you say “the ocean depths?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What else should I say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> You might have said the “bottom of the
sea,” or the “sea bottom.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh! mayn’t I just as well say in the ocean
depths?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Of course, only it sounds so odd to hear people
talk of the depths of the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Why? Tell me why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, I won’t, for it’s so silly——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I’m sure it’s not. Now, tell me why you
smiled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Well, it’s because when I happen to remember
what’s in there—all of a sudden—it always
seems to me that the whole room and everything in it
should be called the “depths of the ocean”—but
that’s so silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You must not say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, for it’s only a loft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking steadily at her</i>). Are you so sure of
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>astonished</i>). That it’s a loft!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Mother can take photographs, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh, yes! I’ve had plenty of opportunity to
teach myself <i>that</i> art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Then, perhaps, it’s you really that attend
to the business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, when Ekdal hasn’t <ins id='c070' title='original: times'>time</ins> himself, I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No doubt, his time’s a great deal taken up
with his old father. I understand that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, and then it’s not the thing for a man like
Ekdal to take portraits of anybody and everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So I think, but still, since he has taken it
up—I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Mr. Werle, I’m sure, can understand that
Ekdal is not an ordinary photographer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Of course not—— But—— (<i>A shot is
fired within the loft, he starts.</i>) What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Up there they are shooting again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Do they shoot too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> They go a-hunting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What hunt? (<i>Going towards the door of the
loft.</i>) Are you hunting, Hjalmar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>behind the net</i>). Are you here? I didn’t
know—I was so taken up—— (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span>.) And
you didn’t tell us——</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Comes into the studio.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Do you go a hunting in the loft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>showing a double-barreled pistol</i>). Oh! only
with this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, you and grandfather’ll have an accident
one of these days with that pigstol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>vexed</i>). I think I’ve told you, that this kind
of fire-arm is called a pistol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, I don’t think that’s any better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So you too have turned hunter; you too,
Hjalmar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Only a little rabbit shooting now and
again. Chiefly for father’s sake, you understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Men folk are such queer creatures; they
must always have something to divide themselves
with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Yes, yes, of course, we must
always have something to divide ourselves with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Why that’s exactly what <i>I</i>’m saying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, h’m! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>.) And then luckily
you see the loft is so situated that no one can hear us
shooting. (<i>Putting the pistol on the top shelf of the case.</i>)
Don’t touch the pistol, Hedvig! The one barrel’s
loaded, remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking in through the net</i>). Oh, you’ve a
fowling-piece too, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That’s father’s old gun. You can’t shoot
with it now, for there’s something wrong with the
lock. But it’s very amusing to have it, all the same,
because we can take it all to pieces, and oil it, and
then screw it together again. Of course its mostly
father who muddles about with such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>going up to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). Now you can see the
wild duck properly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I was just looking at it. One of her wings
drops a little it seems to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, that’s not so remarkable; you know
she was wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And she seems a little lame in one foot,
isn’t she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Perhaps just a very little bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, for the dog bit her in that foot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But she hasn’t another fault or blemish;
and that is really remarkable for a creature that has
had a discharge of shot into its body, and has been
between a dog’s teeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>with a glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span>). And who has been
to the depths of the ocean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>setting the table</i>). Oh! that blessed wild duck!
You’ll be falling down and worshipping her next.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> H’m—is the lunch nearly ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, in a moment. Hedvig, you must come
and help me now.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>go out into the kitchen</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>in a lower voice</i>). I don’t think you’d better
stand there looking at father; he doesn’t like it.
(<span class="smcap">Gregers</span> <i>moves away from the door of the loft</i>.) And I’d
better shut up before the others come in. (<i>Shooing with
his hands.</i>) S’h! s’h! Get away with you! (<i>He pulls
up the curtain and shuts the doors.</i>) These contrivances
are my own inventions. It’s really very amusing to
have something like that to arrange, and to mend
when it gets broken. And besides, it is quite necessary,
too, you see, for Gina doesn’t like having the
rabbits and fowls in the studio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, of course not; and, perhaps, it’s your
wife who manages the business?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I usually leave every-day business to her,
for then I can seek refuge in the sitting-room, and
think over more important matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What sort of matters, Hjalmar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I wonder you’ve not asked about <i>that</i> before?
Or, perhaps, you’ve not heard about the invention?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Invention? No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Really? You’ve not? Ah! well, up there
in the woods and wilds——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So you’ve made an invention!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, I’ve not exactly made it yet, but I’m
working at it. Surely you can understand that when
I decided to sacrifice myself to photography, it wasn’t
in order to take likenesses of all sorts of commonplace
people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, no, that was what your wife was just
saying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I vowed that if I did devote my powers to
this manual labor I would at least raise it so high
that it should be both an art and a science. And so
I made up my mind to make this remarkable
invention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And in what does the invention consist?
What is it to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Why, my dear fellow, you <ins id='c073a' title="original: musn’t">mustn’t</ins> ask for
such details yet. It takes time, you see. And you
<ins id='c073b' title="original: musn’t">mustn’t</ins> believe that I am inspired by vanity. Truly,
I’m not working for my own sake. Oh, no! It is my
life—a mission that I see before me night and day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What life-mission is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Have you forgotten the old man with the
silver hair?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Your poor father; but what can you really
do for him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I can invoke his self-respect from the
dead, by raising up the name of Ekdal to honor and
respect again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So that is your life-mission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes. I will save the shipwrecked man.
For he did suffer shipwreck when the storm burst
forth over him. Even while those terrible investigations
were going on he was no longer himself. That
pistol there—that we used to shoot rabbits with—it
has played a part in the tragedy of the house of
Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> The pistol! Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> When the sentence was pronounced and
he was to be put in <ins id='c074' title='original: goal'>gaol</ins>—he had that pistol in his
hand——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> He had!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, but he did not dare. He was afraid.
So demoralized, so lost even then was his spirit. Ah!
Can you understand that? He a soldier; he who had
shot nine bears, the descendant of two lieutenant-colonels—one
after the other, of course. Can you
understand it, Gregers?——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, I understand it very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I do not. And then the pistol played a
part too in another incident in the history of our house.
When he had donned the gray dress, and was set under
lock and key—ah! believe me that was a terrible time
for me. I had pulled down the blinds of both my
windows. When I looked out, I saw that the sun was
shining as was its wont. I could not understand. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
saw men walking about the streets, laughing and
gossipping of indifferent matters. I could not understand.
I thought all the universe must be standing
still as at an eclipse of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I felt so when my mother died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> In that same hour Hjalmar Ekdal turned
the pistol towards his own breast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So you, too, thought of that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But you did not fire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No. In that decisive moment I gained the
victory over myself. I went on living. But, believe me,
it needed courage to choose <i>life</i> under such conditions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It depends on the point of view.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, entirely. But it was better so; for
now I shall soon make the invention; and then Doctor
Relling believes, as I do, myself, that father will get
leave to wear his uniform again. I shall ask this as
my sole reward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So it’s the uniform that he——?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes; it is <i>that</i> that he most hankers and
pines after. You can not imagine how this cuts me to
the heart for his sake. Whenever we have a little
family feast here—such as Gina’s and my wedding-day,
or anything of that sort—the old man comes in
here dressed in his lieutenant uniform of happier days.
But as soon as there’s a knock at the door—for he
mustn’t show himself before strangers you know—he
hurries off to his room again as fast as his old legs will
carry him. It lacerates a filial heart to see that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And when do you think your invention’ll
be ready?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Now, really you mustn’t ask me about such
details as to time. An invention is a thing which
doesn’t allow a man to be wholly and solely master of
himself. It depends a good deal on inspiration—on
an idea—and it’s well-nigh impossible to calculate
beforehand when that will come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But it’s making progress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Of course it’s making progress. I work
every blessed day at the invention, which fills my whole
being. Every afternoon when I’ve dined, I lock myself
up in my sitting-room, there I can ponder in peace.
Only I mustn’t be driven, for that is no earthly use whatever;
Relling says so, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And don’t you find that all those contrivances
in there in the loft, take you away and distract
you too much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, no, no; quite the contrary. You
mustn’t say that. Surely, I can’t always go about
brooding over the same exhausting ideas. I must
have something to fill up the time spent in expectancy.
Inspiration, ideas, you see—if they’re coming they’ll
come anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> My dear Hjalmar, I almost think there’s
something of the wild duck in you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Of the wild duck? What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You have dived under and got caught fast
in the weeds at the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Are you alluding to the well-nigh deadly
shot that winged father and me too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Not so much to <i>that</i>. I don’t mean to say
that you are wounded, but you have fallen into a
poisonous swamp; you have within you an insidious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
disease, and you have sunk to the bottom to die in the
dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I? Die in the dark? Now, I tell you what,
Gregers, you really should drop such talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Do not fear; for I will bring you up to the
surface again. For I, too, have a mission in life now,
you see; I found it, yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, that may be; but you should leave
me alone. I assure you that—of course, with the
exception of a very natural melancholy—I am as
happy as a man could desire to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> That you <i>are</i> so, is also a result of the
poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Now, my dear, good Gregers, don’t say
anything more about disease and poison; I’m not used
to that sort of thing; in my house no one ever mentions
such disagreeable things to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Ah! I can well believe <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> For it’s not good for me. And here there
is no air of the swamp as you call it. The poor home
of the photographer is lowly—I know that well—and
my means are narrow. But, I am an inventor,
remember, and I am the bread-winner of a family too.
<i>That</i> raises me above my lowly circumstances—— Ah!
here they are with the luncheon!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>bring bottles of beer, a decanter of brandy,
glasses and so forth. At the same time</i> <span class="smcap">Relling</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Molvik</span> <i>enter from the passage; they are both without
hats and top coats</i>; <span class="smcap">Molvik</span> <i>is dressed in black</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>putting the things on the table</i>). Well, those two
timed it well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Molvik fancied he smelt herring-salad, and
so there was no holding him back. Good morning for
the second time, Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Gregers, let me introduce Mr. Molvik;
doctor—— Why you know Relling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, slightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Ah! This is Mr. Werle, junior. Yes, we
two have often come to loggerheads with one another
up at the Hojdal Works. I suppose you’ve just
moved in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I moved in this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> And Molvik and I live underneath you, so
you’re not far from the doctor and priest, if you
should want anything of the sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> That might be; for yesterday we were
thirteen at table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh! now don’t bring up such disagreeable
things again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> You needn’t trouble, Ekdal, for it won’t hurt
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I hope so for the sake of my family. But
let’s sit down and eat, and drink, and be merry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Shall we not wait for your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No, he’ll have his taken into him presently.
Come along!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The men sit down at the table, and eat and drink.</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>go in and out waiting on them</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Molvik was horribly drunk yesterday, Mrs.
Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> What! Yesterday again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Didn’t you hear him when I came home
with him in the night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, I can’t say I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> That’s well; for Molvik was abominable
last night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Is that true, Molvik?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molvik.</span> Let us bury in oblivion the proceedings of
last night. That sort of thing has nothing to do with
my better self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). It comes over him as if he
were possessed, and then I have to go out on the spree
with him. For you see Mr. Molvik is dæmonic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Dæmonic?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, Molvik is dæmonic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> H’m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> And dæmonic natures are not created for
going through the world on steady legs. They are
bound to deviate sometimes. Well, and so you still
hold out at those hideous black Works up there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I have held out until now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> And have you obtained what you went
about claiming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Claiming? (<i>Understanding him.</i>) Oh! I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Have you been enforcing claims, Gregers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh! nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Oh! but he did, though; he used to go
about to all the farmers’ cottages presenting something
that he called “the claim of the ideal.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I was young then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> You’re right <i>there</i>; you were very young.
And the claim of the ideal—you never managed to
get them honored as long as <i>I</i> was up there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Nor since either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> And so, I dare say you’ve become sensible
enough to reduce your demands a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Never when I am face to face with a true,
genuine man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No; and that seems sensible enough to
me. A little butter, Gina.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> And a little bit of pork for Molvik.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molvik.</span> Uh! No pork!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>There is a knock at the door of the loft.</i></p>

so many hairs left on his head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Well; you can get through life with false
hair. Yes, at the bottom you’re a happy man, Ekdal;
you have that great life-mission to toil for——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> And I do toil, believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> And then you have your active wife, trotting
in and out so nicely, in her felt shoes, and pottering
about, looking after you and serving you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Ah! but that’s so lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Only wait till that wonderful invention is
completed, Hedvig!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, then—then you will see!—Hedvig,
I have determined to make your future secure. All
shall be well with you as long as you live. I will ask
something for you—and nothing else. <i>That</i> shall be
the poor inventor’s sole reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>whispering, with her arms about his neck</i>). Oh!
you dear, dear father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). Well, now, don’t you think it
very pleasant, just for a change, to sit at a well-spread
table in the midst of a happy family circle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, I deeply prize these hours spent at
table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I, for my part, do not thrive in the air of
a swamp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Air of a swamp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Oh! now don’t begin with that stuff again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Goodness knows there’s no foul air here, Mr.
Werle, for I air the place every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>rising from the table</i>). The stench I mean,
no amount of your airing would get rid of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Stench!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, what do you think of that, Ekdal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Excuse me—I suppose it isn’t you yourself
who brings this stench with you from the mines
up there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It would be like you to call what I bring
into this house a stench.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>going up to him</i>). Listen, Mr. Werle, junior,
I strongly suspect you are still going about with “the
claim of the ideal” unabridged in your coat-tail
pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I carry it in my breast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Well, wherever you may have it, I’d not
advise you to play the dun here as long as I’m about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And suppose I do all the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Then you fly head-foremost down stairs.
Now you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>rising</i>). But really, Relling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, just you turn me out——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>coming between them</i>). You mustn’t do that,
Relling. But <i>this</i> I will say, Mr. Werle, that after
making all that horrid mess in there with the stove,
you shouldn’t come here chattering about stenches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>There is a knock at the door.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Mother, someone’s knocking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That’s it! Now we’re to be bothered with
a lot of people!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Only leave it to me—— (<i>She goes and opens

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>in a choking voice</i>). Yes——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>coming nearer</i>). Won’t you come in, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Thanks; I only wish to speak to my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Well! Here I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> I should like to speak to you in your room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, goodness knows, that’s not in a fit state

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Well, outside in the passage, then; I wish to
speak to you alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> You can do that here, sir. Come into the
sitting-room, Relling.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Relling</span> <i>go in, right</i>; <span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>takes</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span>
<i>with her into the kitchen</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>after a short pause</i>). Well, we’re alone now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> You let fall a word or two yesterday, and as
you’ve come to live at the Ekdals I am compelled to
think that you’ve something in your mind against me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I have in mind to open Hjalmar Ekdal’s
eyes. He shall see his position as it is; that is all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Is that the mission in life you spoke of
yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes. You have left none other open to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Is it I who have poisoned your mind,
Gregers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You have poisoned my whole life—I’m not
thinking about all that with mother. But it is you I
have to thank for it that I go about hunted and
devoured by a guilty conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Aha! So it’s your conscience that’s amiss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I ought to have stood out against you
then, at the time when you laid the snares for Lieutenant
Ekdal. I ought to have warned him; for I
foresaw whither it would lead him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Yes; then, indeed, you ought to have
spoken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I didn’t dare to; I was so cowed and
scared. I was so afraid of you—both then and for a
long time afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> You’ve got over that fear now it seems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Fortunately. The wrong done old Ekdal,
both by me and others can never be made good; but
I can free Hjalmar from all this lying and deceit
which surround him and are ruining him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Do you believe that that would be doing a
good deed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I believe so—firmly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Perhaps you fancy that the photographer
Ekdal, is the man to thank you for such a friendly
service?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes—he <i>is</i> the man to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> H’m—we shall see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And besides if I am to go on living I must
find some healing for my sick conscience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> That will never be sound. Your conscience
has been sick since you were a child. That is a heritage
from your mother, Gregers, the only heritage she left
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>with a scornful half smile</i>). Haven’t you yet
got over your anger at the mistake you made in
thinking she would bring you a dowry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Don’t let us touch upon irrelevant things—So
you hold to your purpose of putting Ekdal on what
you assume to be the right scent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes; I do hold to my purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Well, then I might have saved myself the
walk up here. For doubtless it’s no use asking if
you’ll come home again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> And I suppose you will not enter the firm
either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Good. But as I intend getting married
soon, there will have to be a division of the property.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> You do not wish it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, I dare not for my conscience sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle</span> (<i>after a short pause</i>). Are you going up to the
Works again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, I consider myself as having left your
service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> But what shall you do then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Only fulfill the mission of my life; nothing
else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Yes, but afterwards? What will you live
on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I have put by a little out of my salary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> And how long will <i>that</i> last!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I think it will last my time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> What do you mean by that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I will answer nothing more now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Werle.</span> Good-bye then, Gregers.</p>

When the friend of my youth feels the desire to open
his heart to me in private!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> But deuce take it—don’t you see the
fellow’s cracked, mad, demented!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, you can surely hear that. His mother
used to have such fits at times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> He has all the greater need for the vigilant

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Do you think young Werle’s really mad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> No, worse luck, he’s not more mad than
most people. But he’s diseased all the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> What is it that’s the matter with him then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Well, I’ll tell you Mrs. Ekdal. He’s suffering
from an acute attack of virtue-fever——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Virtue-fever?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Is that a disease then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Certainly; it’s a national disease; but it
only appears sporadically. (<i>Nodding to</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span>.) Thanks
for your hospitality. (<i>He goes out at the entrance-door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>stopping</i>). Why, you hear I shall spare
her—for your sake. Not a hair of her head shall be

there are greater problems than that to solve. Now
you should go out a little as usual, Hedvig, it’s dark

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, it varies so. I should say it’s about as
much as he costs us, and just a little pocket money
besides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> As much as he costs us! And you never

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>lighting it</i>). And then we don’t know that it is
Mr. Werle himself; it may be Graberg who——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Why these subterfuges about Graberg?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I don’t know, I only thought——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> H’m!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, it wasn’t me that got grandfather the
writing. Why it was Bertha when she went to the
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Your voice seems to me to be trembling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>putting the shade over the lamp</i>). Does it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> And your hands are shaking. Aren’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>firmly</i>). Speak straight out, Ekdal. What is
it he’s gone and said about me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Is it true—<i>can</i> it be true that—that there
was a kind of relation between you and Mr. Werle,
while you were in service at his house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> That is not true. Not at that time, no. Mr.
Werle was after me, certainly. And the wife fancied
there was something in it, and then she made such a
hocus-pocus and hurly-burly, and she knocked me
about and drove me about so—that she did—and so
I left her service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span>—Afterward then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes. Then I went home. And mother—she
wasn’t as good as you thought, Ekdal; and she kept
on at me about one thing and another—for Mr.
Werle was a widower then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Well, and then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, I suppose it’s best you should know it.
He didn’t let me alone until he’d had his will of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>clasping his hands</i>). And this is the mother
of my child! How could you conceal such a thing
from me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, that was wrong of me; I ought certainly
to have told you long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> You ought to have told it me at once.
Then I should have known what sort of a creature
you were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But would you have married me all the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> How can you imagine such a thing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No; that is why I did not dare tell you anything
then. For I grew to care so very much for you,
as you know. And I couldn’t go and make myself
absolutely wretched——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>walking about</i>). And this is my Hedvig’s
mother. And to know all that I see before my
eyes—— (<i>Kicking a chair.</i>)—All my home—I owe it
all to a favored predecessor. Ah! that seducer,
Werle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Do you repent the fourteen or fifteen years
that we have lived together?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>standing in front of her</i>). Tell me, have you
not repented every day, every hour, for the web of
deceit that, like a spider, you have spun around me?
Answer me that! Have you not really gone about
here remorseful and penitent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Ah! dear Ekdal, I’ve had quite enough to
think of with the house and all the daily work——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> So you never cast a searching glance at
your past?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No; God knows, I had almost forgotten those
old intrigues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! This callous, insensible calm! There
is something so revolting to me in this! Think—not
even remorse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But tell me, Ekdal, what would have become
of you if you had not found a wife like me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Like you——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, for I’ve always been a little more businesslike
and practical than you. Well, of course, that’s
natural, for I’m a few years older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> What would have become of me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> For you had got into all sorts of bad
habits when you first met me; you surely can’t deny
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> So you call those bad habits! Ah! you
don’t understand a man’s feelings, when he is in sorrow
and despair—especially a man with my fiery temperament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, well, that may be. And I’m not regaling
about all that either; for you became such a model
husband as soon as ever you’d a house and home of
your own. And now we’ve made it all so comfortable
and cosy here; and Hedvig and I were soon going to
spend a little more both for food and clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> In the swamp of deceit, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh! that that abominable fellow should ever
have set foot in this house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I too thought home good to be in. That
was a delusion. Whence now shall I get the needful
elasticity of mind to bring the invention into the
world of realities. Perhaps it will die with me, and
then it will be your past, Gina, that has slain it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>almost crying</i>). No, you mustn’t say any such
thing, Ekdal. I, who all my days have only tried to
do the best for you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I ask—what becomes now of the bread-winner’s
dream? When I lay in there on the sofa
pondering over the invention, I already had the presentiment
that it would devour my whole powers. I
felt, too, that the day when I should hold the patent in
my hands—that day would be my last. And so it was
my dream that you should be left here the well-to-do
widow of the departed inventor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>drying her tears</i>). No, you <i>must</i> not speak like
that, Ekdal. God forbid I should live to see the day
when I was a widow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! ’tis all one. Now all this is past anyhow.
All!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> What don’t you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> So great a reckoning—a reckoning that is
to lay the foundation of a new life—the living together
in truth and without all deceit——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, I know that well enough, I know that
so well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I felt so sure that as I entered the door, a
light of transfiguration and joy from the faces of both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, of course, I do. That is to say, after
a fashion.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Hallo! Is the wild duck to the fore
again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Mr. Werle senior’s broken-winged victim
of the chase, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Mr. Werle senior’s? Is it he you are
speaking of?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Of him and of—us others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>in a low tone to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). The devil take you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> What is that you’re saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> I was wishing heartily that the quack
would take himself off home. If he stops here
he’s just the man to muddle things up for you
both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Things will not be muddled for these two,
Mr. Relling. I will not speak of Hjalmar now. Him
we know. But she, too, at the bottom of her heart
must surely have some truth, some sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>tearfully</i>). You might have let me pass for
what I <i>was</i> then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). Would it be impertinent to
inquire, what it is you really want in this house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I wish to lay the foundation of a true
marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> So you don’t think that the Ekdal’s
marriage is good enough as it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It is certainly quite as good a marriage as
most others, unfortunately. But it has not yet become
a <i>true</i> marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> You have never had any sense for the
claims of the ideal, Relling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Stuff and nonsense, my good fellow! With
your permission, Mr. Werle—how many—approximately—how
many true marriages have you seen in
your life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I hardly think I’ve seen a single one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Nor have I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But I have seen such numberless marriages
of the opposite kind. And I have had occasions to see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
from personal observation, how such marriages can
demoralize two human beings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> The whole moral foundation of a man may
give way beneath his feet; <i>that</i> is the terrible part of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Well, I’ve never exactly been married, so
I’m no judge of such things. But this I do know, the
<i>child</i> is part of the marriage too. And you must leave
the child at peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! Hedvig! My poor Hedvig!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, you must be so good as to keep
Hedvig out of all this. You two are grown-up people;
you can, in God’s name muddle and meddle with your
lives, if you feel inclined. But you must be careful
with Hedvig, I tell you, else you may do her a mischief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> A mischief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes—or she may do herself a mischief!—and
perhaps others, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But how can <i>you</i> know that, Relling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> There is no immediate danger to her
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> This has nothing to do with her eyes. But
Hedvig is at an awkward age. She might get into all
sorts of mischief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, just fancy—she does that already! She’s
begun carrying on with the fire out in the kitchen.
She calls it playing at house on fire. I’m often
frightened she’ll set fire to the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> There you see, I knew it well enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Relling</span>). But how do you account for
this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>sulkily</i>). She is passing through a constitutional
change, man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby</span>, <i>in walking costume, comes in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Good evening!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>going up to her</i>). What, is it you, Bertha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Yes, indeed it is. I hope I’m not in the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Not in the least; an emissary from <i>that</i>
house——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Frankly, I didn’t expect to find your
men-folk at home about this time; and so I ran up for
a little chat with you, and to bid you good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Really? Are you going away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Yes, early to-morrow; up to Hojdal.
Mr. Werle left this afternoon. (<i>Lightly to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>.)
He sent his greetings to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, I never!——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> So Mr. Werle has gone away? And now
you are going after him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Yes, what do you think of that, Ekdal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I say, be on your guard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I can explain it to you. My father is
going to marry Mrs. Sorby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Marry her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Really, Bertha, at last then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>his voice trembles slightly</i>). Surely this isn’t
true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Yes, dear Relling, it is true enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Are you going to marry again now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Yes, it looks like it. Werle has got a
special license and so we’re going to keep our wedding
quite quietly up at the Works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I suppose as a good step-son I must wish
you happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Thank you—if you really mean it.
And I hope it will be for both Werle’s and my own
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> You may certainly hope that. Mr. Werle
never gets drunk——so far as I know; and he’s
certainly not in the habit of beating his wives either,
like the late lamented horse-doctor used to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Ah! let Sorby be in peace where he
lies. He also had his good sides; he, too——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> But Mr. Werle has better sides, I dare swear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> At any rate he hasn’t wasted what was
best in him. The man who does that must take the
consequences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> I shall go out this evening with Molvik.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> You shouldn’t do that, Relling. Don’t
do it—for my sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> There’s nothing else for it. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span>.)
If you want to make one of us, come along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, thanks. Ekdal doesn’t go in for that sort
of divulsions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>vexed, in a low voice</i>). Ah! be quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Good-by, Mrs.—— Werle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>He goes out through the entrance-door.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby</span>). It seems you and Dr. Relling
knew one another pretty intimately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Yes, we’ve known one another for many
a year. Once, indeed, it might have come to something
between us, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It was a good thing for you it didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> You may well say that. But I
have always taken care not to act upon impulse.
And a woman can’t throw herself quite away,
either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Are you not in the least afraid that I might
give my father a hint as to this old acquaintance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Surely you understand that I have told
him myself<ins id='c103a'>.</ins></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Your father knows down to the very
least detail all that people might fairly say against me<ins id='c103b'>.</ins>
I have told him all this; it was the first thing I did
when he let me see his intentions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You are more than commonly frank, I
think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> I have always been frank. That’s the
best way for us women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> What do you say to that, Gina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Ah! we women are so different, we are. Some
take one way and some another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Yes, Gina, but I believe it is wisest to
arrange matters as I have done. And Werle, too, has
concealed nothing of what concerns himself from me.
Indeed, it was <i>that</i> which chiefly brought us together.
Now he can sit and talk to me as frankly as a child<ins id='c103c'>.</ins>
He has never been able to do that all his life. He, the
strong man, full of life, heard nothing all through his
youth and all through the best years of his life but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
sermons. And many a time the sermons were about
merely imaginary offenses—as I’ve heard say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, what they say’s true enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> If you ladies are going to discuss that subject
I had better go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> You needn’t go on that account. I shall
not say another word. I only wanted you to know
that I had done nothing deceitful or in any way underhand.
It may be, perhaps, a great piece of good fortune
for me—and so indeed it is in some respects.
But still I think I receive no more than I give.
Assuredly I shall never fail him. And I shall serve
him and tend him as no one else could, now that he is
becoming helpless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Helpless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby</span>). Don’t speak of that here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> It’s no use hiding it any longer, much as
he would like to. He’s going blind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>starting</i>). Going blind? That’s strange.
He is going blind, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> So many people do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> And you can imagine what that means
to a business man. Well, I shall try to use my
eyes for him as well as I can. But I mustn’t
stay any longer, I’m so busy just now—oh! I was
to tell you Ekdal, that if there was anything
Werle could do for you, you have only to apply to
Graberg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I’m sure Hjalmar Ekdal will decline that
offer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Indeed? I don’t think he used to
be so——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, Bertha, Ekdal wants nothing more from
Mr. Werle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>slowly and emphatically</i>). Will you present
my compliments to your future husband, and tell him
that I intend very shortly to call upon the book-keeper,
Graberg——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What! You’ll do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> ——to call upon the book-keeper, Graberg,
I say, and ask for an account of the money I owe his
principal. I shall pay back this debt of honor—ha,
ha, ha! let us call it a debt of honor! But enough of
this. I shall repay the whole with five per cent interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But, dear Ekdal, goodness knows we’ve not
the money to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Will you tell your betrothed that I am
working indefatigably at my invention. Will you tell
him that what sustained my strength for this exhausting
labor, is the desire to be rid of the torture of this
load of debt. That’s why I go on with the invention.
I shall devote the whole of the profits to the repayment

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Something has happened in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, there has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sorby.</span> Well, good-bye then. There are lots of
things I want to talk to you about, Gina, but they must
wait till another time. Good-bye.</p>

Gregers! Now I am free of this dead weight <ins id='c106' title='original: fo'>of</ins>
indebtedness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> At any rate you soon will be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I think my attitude may be called correct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You are the man I have always taken you
for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> In certain cases it is impossible to set aside
the claims of the ideal. As the bread-winner of a
family, I must writhe and agonize beneath this. For
believe me, it’s no joke for a man of small means to
pay off a debt that has been accumulating for years,
over which, so to say, the dust of oblivion lies. But be
this as it may, the Man in me too demands his rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>putting his hands on his shoulders</i>). Dear
Hjalmar—was it not well that I came?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> That you were shown clearly your true
position—was it not well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>somewhat impatiently</i>). Yes, of course it was
well. But there is one thing against which my sense
of justice revolts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And what is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> It is this, that—but I really don’t know if
I may express myself so freely about your father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Pray do not mind me in the least!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Very well. You see, it seems to me so
revolting to think that now it is not I, but he who will
realize the true marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> How can you say such a thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But it is so. For your father and Mrs.
Sorby are entering upon a marriage-contract founded
upon complete confidence, founded upon perfect and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
absolute frankness on both sides; there are no concealments
between them; there’s nothing kept in the
background in their relation; the two sinners, if I may
so express myself, proclaim mutual forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Well, and what then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But that’s the whole point of the thing.
Why it was all these difficulties, as you yourself said,
that were needed to found a true marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But this is quite another matter, Hjalmar.
Surely you would not conjure either yourself or her
with those two. Oh! you understand me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But I can’t get away from the fact, that in
all this there is something that wounds and offends
my sense of rectitude. Why, it looks exactly as if
there were no righteous providence in the direction
of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh! Ekdal, God knows you <ins id='c107' title="original: musn’t">mustn’t</ins> say such
things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> H’m, don’t let us enter upon that question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But, on the other hand, I seem to behold
the guiding finger of Fate. He is going blind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh! perhaps that’s not so very certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> It is indubitable. We, at any rate, ought
not to question that, for it is just in this fact that
there lies the righteous retribution. He has in his
time blinded a trusting fellow-creature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Unfortunately he has blinded many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> And now Fate, the inexorable, the
mysterious, demands his own eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> How can you dare to say such awful things!
I’m quite frightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes. It’s something for to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> You mustn’t know now; for mother’s to give

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! All this companionship from which
I am shut out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>quickly</i>). No, you can see if you like it. It’s
a big letter. (<i>Taking the letter from her cloak pocket.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> A letter, too?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, it’s only a letter. I suppose the other’s
coming later. But fancy—a letter! I’ve never had a
letter before. And there’s “Miss” on the outside.
(<i>Reads.</i>) “Miss Hedvig Ekdal.” Fancy—that’s
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Let me see that letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>holding it out to him</i>). There, you can see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> It is Mr. Werle’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Are you sure of that, Ekdal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> See for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh! Do you think I understand anything
about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Hedvig, may I open the letter—and read
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, of course you may, if you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, not to-night, Ekdal; why it’s for
to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>in a low tone</i>). Oh! do let him read it! It’s
sure to be something nice, and then father’ll be glad
and he’ll be in good spirits again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Then I may open it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, please do, father. It’ll be such fun to
know what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Good. (<i>He opens the letter, takes out a
paper, reads it through and seems confused.</i>) What is
this!——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> What’s in it, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, yes, father—tell us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Be silent. (<i>Reads it through again; he
turns pale but masters himself.</i>) It’s a deed of gift,
Hedvig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Fancy! What is it I’m to have?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Read it yourself. (<span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>goes to the lamp
and reads a moment</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>in a low voice, clenching his hands</i>). The
eyes! the eyes!—and now this letter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>leaves off reading</i>). Yes, but I think this is
meant for grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>taking the letter from her</i>). You Gina—can
you understand this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Why, I don’t know anything on earth about
it—just tell us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Mr. Werle writes to Hedvig that her old
grandfather need no longer trouble himself with copying,
but that for the future he’s to draw a hundred
crowns a month at the office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Aha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> A hundred crowns, mother! I read that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> That’ll come in very well for grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> ——A hundred crowns as long as he may
need it—that means, of course, until he has closed
his eyes in death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, then he’s provided for, poor old
fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But there’s more follows. You didn’t read
this, Hedvig. Afterwards it’s to revert to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> To me! All of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> He writes that the same sum is assured to
you for your whole life. Do you hear that, Gina?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, I hear well enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Fancy—I’m to have all that money!
(<i>Shaking him.</i>) Father, father, aren’t you glad——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>evasively</i>). Glad! (<i>Walking about the room.</i>)
Ah! what an out-look!—what a perspective unrolls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
itself before me! It is Hedvig, it is she whom he
endows so richly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Why, it’s Hedvig’s birthday——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> And it’ll be yours all the same, father! You
know that I shall give all the money to you and
mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> To mother; yes. That’s it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Hjalmar, this is a snare he is laying for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Do you think this is another snare?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> When he was here this morning he said,
“Hjalmar Ekdal is not the man you take him for.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Not the man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> “You will see that,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> You were to see that I would allow myself
to be bought with money——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> But, mother, what’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Go and take off your things.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>goes out almost crying, at the kitchen door</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, Hjalmar—now we shall see who is
right—he or I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>slowly tears the paper across, and lays both

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I expected it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>going up to</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>who stands by the oven, and
speaking in a low tone</i>). And now no more deceit. If the
connection between you and him was quite at an end,
when you—came to care for me, as you call it—why
did he make it possible for us to marry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I suppose he thought he’d be free of the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Only <i>that</i>? Wasn’t he afraid of a certain
result?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I don’t understand what you mean<ins id='c112'>.</ins></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I want to know if—your child has the
right to live under my roof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>drawing herself up, her eyes flashing</i>). And you
ask that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> You must answer me this one question:
Is Hedvig my child, or——? Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>looks at him with cold defiance</i>). I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>shudders slightly</i>). You don’t know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> How should <i>I</i> know? Such a woman as I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>quietly turning from her</i>). Then I have
nothing more to do in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Think what you’re doing, Hjalmar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>taking up his overcoat</i>). There’s nothing for
a man like me to think about here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, here there is so much to be thought
over. You three must remain together, if you are to
reach the great height of self-sacrificing forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I will not. Never, never! My hat!
(<i>Takes his hat.</i>) My home has fallen into ruins about
me (<i>bursting into tears</i>). Gregers, I have no child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>who has opened the kitchen door</i>). What do
you say? (<i>Going up to him.</i>) Father, father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> There now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Do not come near me, Hedvig. Stand

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). How could that be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Why, mother may have found me. And
now, perhaps, father has got to know it; for I’ve read
about such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Well, but if it were so——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, I think he might love me just as much
for all that. And even more. Why the wild duck,
too, was sent us for a present, and yet I care so much
for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>trying to change the subject</i>). Yes, the wild
duck, that’s true! Let’s talk a little about the
wild duck, Hedvig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> The poor wild duck. He can’t bear to see
her either. Only think, he wanted to wring her neck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Oh! he’ll not do that I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, but he said so. And I think it was so
horrid of father, because I say my prayers for the wild
duck every night and beg she may be preserved from
death, and all that is evil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking at her</i>). Do you always say your
prayers at night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Who taught you to do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> I myself; it was once when father was so ill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and had leeches on his throat, and then he said he was
wrestling with death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> So I prayed for him after I had gone to bed.
And ever since I’ve gone on with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And now you pray for the wild duck, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> I thought it would be best to put the wild
duck in too, for she was so sickly at first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Do you pray in the morning, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, I don’t do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Why not in the morning as well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Oh! it’s light in the morning, and there’s
nothing to be afraid of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And the wild duck that you’re so very fond
of—your father wanted to wring its neck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, he said it would be best for him if he
did, but that he would spare her for my sake; and that
was very good of father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>coming a little closer</i>). But if you were to sacrifice
the wild duck of your own free will for his sake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>rising</i>). The wild duck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> If you now freely sacrificed for him the
best thing you know and possess on earth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Do you think that would help?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Try it, Hedvig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>in a low voice and brightening eyes</i>). Yes, I
will try.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And do you think you’ve enough strength
of mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> I will ask grandfather to shoot her for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, do so. But not a word of all this to

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> There, you see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> For the porter’s wife said she could hear
that Relling had two people with him when he came
home in the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> That’s just what I thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> But that’s no good if he won’t come up to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Oh, nonsense! Grandfather mustn’t hear anything

during all that hullaballoo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, but——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> He has like enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, but he—so in need of solitude and of

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, you may well say that.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> <i>comes in from the passage</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> (<i>going up to him</i>). Is father with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>at the same time</i>). Is he there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, of course he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> And you never told us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, I’m a brute—but I had to get the

then I fell so sound asleep that——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> What does Ekdal say to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> He doesn’t say anything whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Doesn’t he say anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Not a blessed word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, no; I can well understand that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But what’s he doing then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> He’s lying on the sofa, snoring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Really? Yes, Ekdal’s a great one to snore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Is he asleep? Can he sleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling<ins id='c119'>.</ins></span> Well, it looks like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Very natural after the spiritual strife that
has torn him——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> And especially as he’s not accustomed to
knocking about at night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Perhaps it’s as well, mother, that father is
able to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I think so, too. But now it’s not worth while
for us to go and wake him too soon. Thank you,
anyhow, Relling. I must first tidy up the rooms and
then—— Come and help me, Hedvig.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>go into the sitting-room</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Relling</span>). Can you explain to me
the spiritual turmoil now going on in Hjalmar Ekdal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Upon my soul I’ve not noticed any spiritual
turmoil going on in him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What! At such a juncture, when a new
foundation is being laid for his whole life. Now, can
you imagine that a man of Hjalmar’s individuality——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Oh! Individuality—he! If he ever had
any tendencies to the abnormal developments that you
call individuality, they were extirpated, root and
branch, while he was yet a boy; I can assure you of
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> That would be strange after the loving
care with which he was brought up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> You mean by those two affected, hysterical
maiden aunts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I may tell you they were women who never
lost sight of the claims of the ideal—ah! you’ll gibe
at me again, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> No, I’m in no humor for that. <ins id='c120' title='original: Morever'>Moreover</ins>, I
know it all, for he has poured forth any amount of
rhetoric about his “two spiritual-mothers.” But I
don’t think he has much to thank them for. It is
Ekdal’s misfortune that in his circle he has always
been taken for a shining light——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And isn’t he one? In depth of soul I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> I’ve never noticed anything of the sort.
That his father should have believed this—well and good;
for the old lieutenant has been a blockhead all his life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> All his life he has been a man with a child-like
mind—<i>that</i> is what you can not understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Tut, tut! But as soon as the dear, sweet
Hjalmar went to college, his fellow students instantly
took him for the coming man. He was good looking,
the rascal—red and white—just the sort of thing to
delight a school girl—and as he had that mobile
temperament and that sympathetic voice, and was so
clever at declaiming the verses and ideas of others——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Is it of Hjalmar Ekdal you
are speaking like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, with your permission; that’s how the
idol before which you lie prostrate, looks from within.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yet I don’t think I am altogether blind either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Oh! you’re not so very far from it. For
you are a sick man too, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> There you are right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Exactly. You are suffering from a complicated
complaint. First, there’s that troublesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
virtue-fever; and what’s worse, you’re always working
yourself up into a delirium of hero-worship. You
must always have something to admire outside yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Yes, indeed, I must seek it outside myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> But you make such woeful blunders about
the mighty paragons you think you see and hear about
you. Here you’ve been visiting a farmer’s cottage
again with your claims of the ideal; but the people in
this house aren’t solvent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> If you haven’t a better opinion of Hjalmar
Ekdal than that, what pleasure can you find in being
so constantly in his company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Good heavens, I’m ashamed to say I’m supposed
to be a sort of a kind of doctor, and so I must look
after the poor diseased folk living in the same house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Indeed! Is Hjalmar Ekdal diseased, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Most people are, unfortunately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And what remedy are you applying to
Hjalmar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> My usual one. I take care to keep up his
life-lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> The life—lie? Did I hear correctly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, I said life-lie. For the life-lie is
the stimulating principle, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> May I ask with what sort of a life-lie
Hjalmar is infected?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> No, thanks, I don’t betray such secrets to
quacks. You’d be quite capable of muddling him up
even more for me. But the method is infallible. I’ve
applied it to Molvik, too. I’ve made him “dæmonic.”
That’s the phantasy I’ve had to put into <i>his</i> head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Then he’s not dæmonic?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> What the devil does it mean to be dæmonic?
That’s only the gammon I invented to keep him going.
If I’d not done that the poor, inoffensive fellow would
have succumbed to self-contempt and despair many a
long year ago. And then the old lieutenant! But he
really hit upon his own cure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Lieutenant Ekdal? What of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, think of it, he, the bear-hunter, goes
into that gloomy loft and hunts rabbits! There’s not
a sportsman on earth happier than that old man, when
he’s bustling about in there with all that rubbish. The
four or five withered Christmas trees that he stored up
there are to him the same as the whole of the great,
fresh Hojdal forest; the cock and the hens are to him
game perched on the top of fir trees, and the rabbits
hopping about the floor of the loft, they are the bears
he grapples with, he, the hardy old hunter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Unfortunate old Lieutenant Ekdal, yes.
He certainly has had to modify the ideals of his youth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> But, by the way, Mr. Werle, junior—don’t use
that foreign word “ideals.” We’ve as good a word, “lies.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Do you think the two things are akin, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Yes, much as typhus and putrescent fever are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Doctor Relling, I shall not rest content
until I have rescued <ins id='c122a' title='original: Hjalmer'>Hjalmar</ins> from your clutches!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> That would be worst for <i>him</i>. If you take
away the average man’s life-lie you take away his
happiness at the same time. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span>, <i>who comes in
from the sitting-room</i>.) Well, little mother of the wild<ins id='c122b' title='original: -'> </ins>duck.
I’m going down now to see if our father’s still

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> I suppose your strength of mind failed
you when it came to the point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, it’s not that exactly. But when I woke
up early this morning and thought over what we’d
talked about, it seemed to me that it was so strange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Strange?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, I don’t know—— Yesterday evening,
directly after, I thought there was something so
beautiful about it; but after I’d been to sleep and
thought it over again, there seemed to be nothing
in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Ah no! I suppose you couldn’t have
grown up here without some falling off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> That doesn’t matter, if only father would
come up, I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Ah! If only your eyes had been really
opened to that which makes life of value—if you had
the real, joyous, brave spirit of sacrifice you would
soon see that he would come up to you—— But I
still have faith in you, Hedvig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Haven’t you ever felt inclined to shoot at
something besides the rabbits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Aren’t the rabbits good enough, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> Yes, but the wild duck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Ha, ha! Are you afraid I shall shoot your
wild duck? Not for the world, never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> No, I suppose you couldn’t; for they say it’s
very difficult to shoot wild ducks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Couldn’t? Should think I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> How would you set about it, grandfather—I
don’t mean with <i>my</i> wild duck, but with another one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Would take care to shoot it under the breast,
you know, for that’s the safest. And then you must
shoot <i>against</i> the feathers, you see, not <i>with</i> the
feathers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedvig.</span> And then they die, grandfather?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ekdal.</span> Yes, of course, if you shoot properly. Well,

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>following him with a portmanteau</i>). Why don’t
you leave the rest for a while, and take a shirt and a

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Phew!—these wearisome preparations!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>He takes off his overcoat and throws it on the sofa.</i></p>

then another.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>dusting the backs of the chairs</i>). The most difficult
thing will be to find such a large loft for the rabbits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> What! Must I drag all the rabbits about
with me, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, grandfather can’t do without the rabbits,
I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> He will have to get used to that. I have
to renounce higher things in life than rabbits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>dusting the book-case</i>). Shall I put the flute into
the portmanteau for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> No. No flute for me. But give me the pistol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Do you want to take the pigstol?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes. My loaded pistol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>looking for it</i>). It’s gone. He must have taken
it in there with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Is he in the loft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Of course he’s in the loft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> H’m—the lonely old man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, then, down stairs at Relling and
Molvik’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Don’t mention those creatures’ names. The

I must go from house to house seeking shelter for
father and myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> But you’ve no hat, Ekdal, <ins id='c130a' title="original: you’v’e">you’ve</ins> lost it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> What are you looking for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Butter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I’ll get you some directly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>She goes into the kitchen.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, you could very well, if you would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> For I can’t see any possibility of getting
all father’s things away at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> And besides you must tell him first that you
won’t go on living with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>pushing the cup of coffee from him</i>). That
too! I shall have to go into all this complicated

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>putting away the letter from</i> <span class="smcap">Werle</span>). I see

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> I’ll take good care of it, Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> The deed of gift belongs first and foremost
to father; and it is for him to say if he intends to make
use of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>sighing</i>). Yes, poor old father——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> For safety’s sake—— Where’s the gum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>going to the book-case</i>). Here’s the gum-pot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Here’s the brush. (<i>She brings him them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>taking up a pair of scissors</i>). Just a bit of

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers Werle</span> <i>comes in from the passage</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>somewhat astonished</i>). What—are you sitting

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>rising hurriedly</i>). I had sunk down from

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You’ve had breakfast too, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Corporal needs make themselves felt at times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What have you decided to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> For a man like me, there is but one way.
I am busy just getting my most important papers
together. But, of course, you know that takes time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>somewhat impatiently</i>). Am I to get the room
ready for you, or am I to pack the portmanteau?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>with a vexed side-glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). Pack—and
get the room ready!——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>taking up the portmanteau</i>). All right, then I’ll
put in the shirt and the other things.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>She goes into the sitting-room and shuts the door after her.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>after a short pause</i>). I never thought it
would end like this. Is it really necessary for you to
leave house and home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>walking about uneasily</i>). What would you
have me do? I was not made to bear unhappiness,
Gregers. I must have comfort, and security, and
peace about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> But can’t you have that? Only try it.
Now, it seems to me, there is firm ground here to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
build upon—and begin from the beginning. And
remember you’ve the invention to live for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Don’t speak of the invention. Perhaps
there’s nothing much in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> How so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Why, good heavens! What do you really
want me to invent? Other men have invented pretty
well everything already. It is becoming more difficult
every day——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And you, who have worked so hard at it——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> It was that debauchee Relling, who made
me take it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Relling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Yes, it was he who first called my attention
to my aptitude for making some remarkable discovery
in photography.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Aha! it was Relling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! I have been so intensely happy over
this. Not so much for the invention or for myself, but
because Hedvig believed in it—with all the strength
and might of a child’s mind. That is to say I was fool
enough to persuade myself she believed in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Can you really believe that Hedvig would
be false to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Now I know what it all means. It is Hedvig
who stands in my way. She will blot out the sun
from my whole life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Hedvig! Do you mean Hedvig? How
could she blot it out for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>without answering</i>). I have loved that child
beyond all words. I was happy beyond all words
whenever I returned to my poor home, and she with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
her sweet little short-sighted eyes flew to meet me.
Confiding fool that I was! I cared for her beyond all
words, and, poet-like, I lulled myself in the delusion
that she also cared for me beyond all words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And you say <i>that</i> was only a delusion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> How can I tell? I can’t get anything out
of Gina. And besides, she lacks all sense of the ideal
side of these complications. But I feel impelled to open
my heart to you, Gregers. There is that terrible doubt—perhaps
Hedvig has never really and truly loved me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You may yet have proof of that. (<i>Listening.</i>)
What is that? The wild duck screaming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> The wild duck’s quacking. Father’s in
the loft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It is he! (<i>His eyes brighten with pleasure.</i>)
I say again you may yet have proof that poor, misunderstood
Hedvig loves you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! what proof can she give me! I dare
not believe in any protestations from that quarter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Hedvig certainly does not know what
deceit is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! Gregers, that’s just what is not so
certain. Who knows what Gina and that Mrs. Sorby
may have sat many a time here whispering and tattling
about? And Hedvig keeps her ears open, I can tell
you. Perhaps, the deed of gift wasn’t so unexpected
after all. I fancy I noticed something of the sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> What has taken possession of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> My eyes have been opened. Watch, and
you’ll see that the deed of gift is but a beginning.
Mrs. Sorby has always done a great deal for Hedvig;
and now it’s in her power to do what she likes for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
child. They can take her from me at any time and
hour they choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Not for all the world would Hedvig go
away from you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Don’t be so sure of that. Suppose they
stood there with their hands full, beckoning her—— Ah!
I, who have loved her beyond all words! I, who
would have found my greatest joy in taking her
tenderly by the hand and guiding her as one guides a
child frightened at the darkness, through some wild
desolate space! Now I feel the gnawing certainty—the
poor photographer in his attic-home has never
been anything wholly and completely to her. She has
only been cunning enough to keep on good terms with
him until the right time should come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> You don’t believe this yourself, Hjalmar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> That’s the terrible part of it, that I don’t
know what to believe—that I never shall know. But
can you really doubt that it must be as I say? Ha,
ha!—You rely too much upon the claims of the ideal,
my good Gregers! If only the others came, with
hands overflowing and cried to the child “leave him,
here with us life awaits you.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>quickly</i>). Well, what then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> If then I asked her: “Hedvig, are you
willing to forego that life for me?” (<i>Laughs mockingly.</i>)
No, thank you—you’d soon hear the answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A pistol shot is heard in the loft.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> I’ll look in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>eagerly and moved</i>). One moment! Do you
know what that was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Of course I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> No, you do not. But I know it. It was
the proof!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> What proof?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It was a child’s sacrifice. She has got your
father to shoot the wild duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Shoot the wild duck!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Well, I never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> But what for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> She wanted to sacrifice for you the best
thing she had on earth; for then she thought you
might learn to love her again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>softly and with emotion</i>). Ah! the child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> What things she does get hold of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> She only wanted to win back your love,
Hjalmar; she felt she could not live with out it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina</span> (<i>struggling with her tears</i>). Now you see yourself,
Ekdal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Gina, where is she?</p>

out in the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>goes to the kitchen door and opens it</i>).
Hedvig—come! Come in to me! (<i>Looking in.</i>) No,
she’s not here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Then she’s sitting in her little room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>outside</i>). No, she’s not here either. (<i>Coming

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, you know you wouldn’t have her about
the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> Ah! if only she will return home soon—that
I may really tell her—— Now all shall be well,
Gregers, for I believe now we can start life afresh.</p>

things. We had no right to keep her, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molvik.</span> The child is not dead; she sleepeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Bosh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>quieting down, he goes to the sofa and looks
at</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>with folded arms</i>). There she lies so stiff and
still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>trying to take the pistol from her hand</i>). She’s
holding it so tight, so tight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> No, no, Relling; don’t break her fingers, let
the pigstol be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar.</span> She shall take it with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> Yes, leave it here. But the child shall not lie
here to be made a show of. She shall go by herself into
her own little room. Help me with her, Ekdal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>take up</i> <span class="smcap">Hedvig</span> <i>between them</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> (<i>as they are carrying her</i>). Oh! Gina, Gina.
Can you bear it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gina.</span> One of us must help the other. For she belongs
to both of us <i>now</i>, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molvik</span> (<i>stretching out his arms and murmuring</i>).
Praised be the Lord; to earth shalt thou return, to
earth shalt thou return——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>whispers</i>). Hold your row, man, you’re
drunk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hjalmar</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gina</span> <i>carry out the dead body at the kitchen
door</i>; <span class="smcap">Relling</span> <i>closes it after them</i>; <span class="smcap">Molvik</span> <i>slinks
out through the passage</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling</span> (<i>goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Gregers</span>). Nothing’ll ever make
me believe that shot was an accident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>who has been standing horror stricken
shuddering convulsively</i>). No one can say how this
terrible thing happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> The powder has singed her dress. She
must have put the pistol straight to her breast and
fired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> Hedvig has not died in vain. Did you see
how grief set free all that is noble in him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Most people are ennobled when they stand
sorrowing by the dead. But how long do you suppose
this fine feeling will last with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> It will last and grow all his life through!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> In three-quarters of a year little Hedvig
will be nothing more to him than an excellent theme
for declamation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> And you dare to say this of Hjalmar
Ekdal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> We’ll talk about it again when the first
grass has withered upon her grave. Then you’ll hear
him perorating about “the father’s heart bereft too
soon of it’s child,” then you’ll see him steeping himself
in emotion and in self-admiration, and self-pity. Wait
and see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers.</span> If you are right, and I am wrong, then
life is not worth living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Ah! life might be pleasant enough all the
same, if only we could be left in peace by those blessed
duns who come worrying us poor folk about the claims
of the ideal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>looking in front of him</i>). At any rate I am
glad that my destiny is what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> I beg your pardon—what is your destiny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregers</span> (<i>going</i>). To be the thirteenth at table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Relling.</span> Devil a doubt of that!</p>
